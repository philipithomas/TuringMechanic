As a project while learning the [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org), I am writing a blog post every day about solving a challenge or building an algorithm in Go. [Fork the website on Github]({{ site.github }}).

You can reach me at [mail@philipithomas.com](mailto:mail@philipithomas.com) or on Twitter as [@philipithomas](https://twitter.com/philipithomas).
