[Problem 5 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) requires finding the least common multiple of the numbers 1 to 20, inclusive. 

The least common multiple (*lcm*) of two numbers is fairly straightforward to calculate, and the function is associative such that `lcm(a,b,c) = lcm(a, lcm(a,b))`. I used this property to iteratively calculate the lcm(1,2), then lcm(lcm(1,2),3), etc. to 20.

Finding the lcm of two positive integers is fairly straightforward:

$$ \operatorname{lcm}(i,j)=\frac{i\cdot j}{\operatorname{gcd}(i,j)} $$

This function uses the greatest common divisor (*gcd*), which is computed recursively using [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Using_Euclid.27s_algorithm).
