[Problem 8 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8) requires finding the largest sum of thirteen consecutive digits of a 1000-digit number. I chose to accomplish this by treating the input as a string and iterating over all substrings to search for the maximum sum.

The algorithm could be improved by detecting `0` digits and skipping sum checks against it. This change would not affect the worst-case runtime, but has the potential to change the best-case runtime to `len(haystack) - needle + 1` (with a haystack of all zeros).
