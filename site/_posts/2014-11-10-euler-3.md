The [third problem of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3) concerns finding the largest prime factor of an integer.

My naive instinct was to start with 1 and check every number until I found the largest number less than the input that was both prime and a factor. As I continued to ponder, I realized that the largest possible prime factor of a number is its square root. Thus, by starting with the square root of the input and decrementing until the test case matched the necessary conditions, the first match is the correct answer.

I did a better job of unit testing this problem because it involved checking whether an input was prime, and the project gave an example input and solution. 

If I were to improve this solution, I would start by build a better `isPrime` function.
