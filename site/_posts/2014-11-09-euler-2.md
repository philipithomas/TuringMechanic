Today I solve the [second problem of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) which involves summing even Fibonacci numbers. While looping through the calculation would have been about as fast, I chose to try a Go Routine to transmit the Fibonacci numbers. This allowed me to separate the logic for creating Fibonacci numbers and the logic for computing the sum of even numbers. 

{% highlight go %}
{% include go/src/euler2/euler2.go %}
{% endhighlight %}

One question this raised is how to conduct testing of channels. I have been creating basic unit tests for Project Euler scripts after I have a confirmed correct answer. This allows me to refactor after finding the correct answer without worry.
