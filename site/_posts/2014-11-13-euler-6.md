[Problem 6 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) requires finding the square of the sums of 1 to 100 minus the sum of squares of 1 to 100.

This operation is quite common in statistics as [a variance calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance). 

I chose to use go routines to calculate the sum and squares concurrently. Only one value ends up being transmitted on `squareChan` before it closes, so it may not be a traditional use of a channel, but it does allow executing the calculation without blocking the other calculation.

{% include go/src/euler6/euler6.go %}
