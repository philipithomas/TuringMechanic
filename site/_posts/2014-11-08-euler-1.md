[Turing Mechanic](/) is a project I am creating while learning the [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org). Every day, I plan to post a new algorithm in Go. The types and diversities of algorithms will change, but the goal is using idiomatic Go code to implement solutions to problems. 

To begin, I will be solving problems to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Subsequent algorithms will likely be focused on books I read regarding algorithms, data structures, concurrency, physics, and operations research. 

I aim to unit test every problem and to post the full source code on Github in the [Turing Mechanic repository]({{ site.github }}). If you have any suggestions - ranging from bug fixes to suggestions for more idiomatic code, please [submit a pull request]({{ site.github }}).

To begin, my first algorithm solves the [first problem of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) using an analysis of multiples:

{% highlight go %}
{% include go/src/euler1/euler1.go %}
{% endhighlight %}

To keep up with Turing Mechanic posts, please stay tuned for social media, RSS, and email subscription options.
