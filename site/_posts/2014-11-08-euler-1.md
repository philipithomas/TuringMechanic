[Turing Mechanic](/) is a project I am creating while learning the [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org). Every day, I plan to post a new algorithm or problem solution in Go. The types and diversities of solutions will change, but the goal is building an understanding of idiomatic Go code by writing software.

To begin, I will be solving problems to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Subsequent posts will likely be focused on books I read regarding algorithms, data structures, concurrency, physics, and operations research. 

I aim to unit test every problem and to post the full source code on Github in the [Turing Mechanic repository]({{ site.github }}). If you have any suggestions - ranging from bug fixes to suggestions for more idiomatic code, please [submit a pull request]({{ site.github }}).

To begin, my first algorithm solves the [first problem of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) using an analysis of multiples:

{% highlight go %}
{% include go/src/euler1/euler1.go %}
{% endhighlight %}

The approach is fairly straightforward. It uses a named return value `sum`. Thus, no variable declaration is needed, and the variable does not need to be explicitly returned. A `return` must still be called, though.

To keep up with Turing Mechanic posts, please stay tuned for social media, RSS, and email subscription options.
