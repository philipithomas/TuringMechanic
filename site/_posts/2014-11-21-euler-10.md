[Problem 10 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10) requires finding the sums of prime numbers below a threshold. This was remarkably similar to [Problem 7](/euler-7/), so I decided to reimplement how I answered the question.

I based my initial solution on a [concurrent prime number sieve](http://play.golang.org/p/9U22NfrXeq) that Rob Pike mentioned during a [talk on Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs) at Google I/O 2012. It daisy-chains prime numbers such that every number emitted from the chain is prime, and it then becomes a filter. The solution worked, but unfortunately was too slow (~15 minutes) because the base emitter had no knowledge of discovered primes.

Thus, I rewrote the search algorithm to use a [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). This algorithm's speed surprised me - it calculated the sum of all primes below 2,000,000 in **250ms**. The primary data structure is a slice of booleans.
