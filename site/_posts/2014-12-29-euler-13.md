[Problem 13 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13) requires finding the first 10 digits of the sum of many 50-digit integers. The sum of these numbers would exceed the capacity for Go's largest unsigned integer, so the complexity comes from how to add these numbers. I originally started building the problem with a clever array that used a carry to sum numbers, but I found out that I was replicating the functionality of a built-in Go library - [math/big](https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/).

Thus, essentially this library allows brute forcing this problem by creating an arbitrarily-large integer. The correct 10 digits are returned as a simple substring of the big integer.
