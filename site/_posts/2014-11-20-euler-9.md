[Problem 9 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9) requires finding the largest sum of thirteen consecutive digits of a 1000-digit number.

I started off by approaching the problem iteratively - I thought that I could use the [Law of Sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines) to cleverly figure out which edge to iterate in order to form a square triangle. However, this proved to be quite difficult - unit tests were failing, there were tons of edge cases, and I couldn't get it to work. 

So, I pulled out a pen and paper to work out a possible solution:

I found a way to iterate through a single variable and then determine the possible other variables. Using this, I implemented a fairly straightforward programmatic solution:

{% highlight go %}
{% include go/src/euler9/euler9.go %}
{% endhighlight %}
