[Problem 7 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) requires finding the 10,001st prime number.

The naive way to approach this would be to go through every number, then check that number to see if it had any factors, until I found 10,001 such numbers. However, [my solution to problem 5](/euler-5/) reminded me that any non-prime number may be factored into primes, and by caching every prime number I found, I could check the modulus of subsequent numbers against the cache. 

Thus, to find the 10,001st prime number, I only need to divide candidates by 10,000 numbers. This sounds high - but it is actually quite efficient! In fact, finding 10,001 primes using this script on my Macbook Air took **541ms**. That's fast! My method for identifying a prime number is efficient, but perhaps there may be a better way to search for prime number candidates.
